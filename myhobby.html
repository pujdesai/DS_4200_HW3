      <h3 class="sub-heading">What is Pickleball?</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Pickleball is a fun and fast-growing sport that is perfect for anyone
        looking to get active without too much pressure. It is easy to learn and
        mixes elements of tennis, ping-pong, and badminton. You play with a
        paddle and a plastic ball with holes, trying to hit it over a net on a
        court that is smaller than a tennis court. The game has simple rules:
        serve underhand, and work together or compete to keep the ball in play.
        Whether you choose to play singles or doubles, you always get a good
        workout and plenty of laughs with friends. What makes pickleball really
        special is its friendly and relaxed vibe. Even if you are new to sports
        or have not played for a while, you can quickly pick up the basics and
        enjoy the game. It is a great way to improve hand-eye coordination, stay
        fit, and have fun at the same time. Many community centers, parks, and
        local clubs now offer pickleball, so it is easy to find a game nearby.
        The sport brings people together and creates a social atmosphere where
        everyone feels welcome. If you are looking for a casual, enjoyable way
        to exercise and make new friends, give pickleball a try. It might just
        become your new favorite sport. It is a perfect sport for both exercise
        and genuine community fun.

      <h3 class="sub-heading">5 Fun Facts About Pickleball</h3>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          Pickleball has a unique “kitchen” or non-volley zone near the net
          where you cannot hit the ball in the air. This rule adds a fun twist
          and keeps the game more strategic.
        </li>
        <li>
          A typical match is played to 11 points, and you must win by at least 2
          points. This simple scoring system makes it easy to keep track of the
          game.
        </li>
        <li>
          The paddles in pickleball are lightweight and made from various
          materials like composite or wood, allowing players to choose one that
          best suits their style.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pickleball was created in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, by a
          group of friends looking for a fun new game.
