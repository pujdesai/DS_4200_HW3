Styling & Customizations:

1. Imported the "Manrope" font from Google Fonts to ensure consistent typography across the site.
2. Applied an animated linear gradient background for a dynamic visual effect.
3. Styled the navigation header with a semi-transparent background, centered links with generous spacing, and hover effects.
4. On the Home Page, centered the main heading and arranged the image and text side by side, with rounded images and subtle shadows.
5. On the My Hobby Page, implemented a flex-column layout with a centered image at the top followed by secondary and sub-headings and justified text.
6. On the Contact Page, created uniformly sized social link buttons with icons, centered them on the page, and added hover effects.
