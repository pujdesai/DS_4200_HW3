        Hi, I'm Pujan Desai. I am a second-year student at Northeastern
        University. I study Computer Science and Business Administration with a
        concentration in Finance. When I'm not busy with school projects or
        studying, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and playing pickleball. I
        played varsity tennis in high school and have been playing tennis for
        many years, so switching to pickleball felt natural. Tennis can be fast
        and tricky, and my friends found pickleball to be much easier and more
        relaxing. Over the summer, I spent a lot of time on the court and
        discovered that pickleball is not only fun, but it also keeps me active.
        I was surprised to learn that it burns a lot of calories. Even after
        playing tennis for years, I did not expect a game of pickleball to make
        me break a sweat. Yet, some competitive matches turned into a solid
        workout. I love the friendly vibe of the game and the chance to unwind.
        I also like that pickleball welcomes everyone, no matter their skill
        level. I even made a few new friends on the court, which made playing
        even more enjoyable. This sport is simple, fun, and a great way to stay
        fit. It is a perfect mix of relaxation and exercise that fits well with
        my busy schedule. If you're curious about pickleball, click on the "My
        Hobby" section to learn some cool things about the sport. Thanks for
        visiting my hobby website, and I hope you enjoy!
